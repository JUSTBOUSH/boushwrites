            { title: "P07.Touching Death",
            content: `It was a golden day, the kind that fools you,

makes you believe the world is soft,

that the sea is only water,

that death is something distant.


The waves kissed the shore, gentle, harmless,

children laughed, the sky stretched wide,

and I

I was only playing.


One step further.

It wouldn‚Äôt hurt.


The water rose to my chest, then my shoulders,

cool against my skin, whispering,

Come closer, just a little more

And I listened.


Then, the Mediterranean opened its mouth.


The ground was gone.

I tried to step back, nothing.

I tried to swim, nothing.

The current wrapped around my ankles like hands,

pulling and pulling and pulling.


A wave struck.

I swallowed salt instead of air.

The sky twisted, the world flipped,

my body tossed like it was weightless,

like I was nothing.


I kicked, I thrashed,

I reached for the shore,

but the sea only laughed,

dragging me further, deeper, darker.


This can‚Äôt be happening.

I was just there, just fine, just breathing

But the sea does not care for logic,

it does not care for pleas.


I fought,

but it was stronger.

I screamed,

but no one heard.

I reached for the sky,

but my fingers found only water.


Then, something in me shifted.


My muscles burned, my chest ached,

the surface seemed impossibly far.

A voice in my head whispered,

‚ÄúMaybe this is it.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe I just‚Ä¶ stop.‚Äù


And then, thoughts.

Not panic. Not terror.

Just thoughts.


My mother.

Would she know? Would she feel it?

When will she notice?

My loved ones.

How would they take the news?

Would they grieve?

Would they know I thought of them in my last breath?


I was not afraid of death.

But I was afraid of dying.


Afraid of the moment my body would go limp,

lungs bursting, eyes open but unseeing.

Afraid of feeling my own soul slip out of my body,

knowing I could not stop it.

Afraid of watching my loved ones from above, not able to comfort them.


Afraid of the silence that would follow all of that.


I saw my body sinking,

arms weak,

lungs screaming.


I had always thought death would feel like fire,

like something violent, something loud.

But it was so quiet.

Soft.

A slow fading.

A breath stolen by the deep.


In mere seconds, my entire life played before my eyes,

a reel of memories unraveling faster than I could grasp.


Then hands.


Hands.


Someone real, someone strong,

My saviour,

ripping me from the dark,

dragging me back,

to air, to light, to life.


I choked, I gasped,

lungs heaving, body shaking,

fingers clawing at the sand

as if to prove I was still here.


I had drowned.

I had died.

And somehow, I had returned.


But something stayed behind,

a part of me still floating in that deep,

still knowing how easy it is

to be here one second

and gone the next.

The sun still shined.

The waves still crashed.

Life still moved forward.


But I

I was not the same.`

        { title: "C05. My Soul Belongs Elsewhere",
            content: `The earth feels too limited for my soul,

too crowded with its edges pressing against my chest.

life here is unfair, a fleeting illusion.

everything beautiful slips through your fingers easily,

like a wisp of smoke,

gone before you even hold it.


Even the happiest days felt unreal,

like an illusion,

like I wasn‚Äôt truly living them.

but oh, my bad ones?

the tough moments,

I lived them fully in every instant,

drowning in their depths,

feeling every ache,

every suffocating second,

and I felt the impact each moment left on me

on my old sweet soul,

on my life,

on the ones I love.

Sorrow stays,

my loyal companion, never far,

always waiting for me in the quiet corners,

a weight I never could put down.


Happiness came like a breeze,

and leaves just as quickly,

no matter how long it lasted

but sadness lingers,

an uninvited guest, living within me

ruining me and all of my days.


Perhaps my soul belongs elsewhere,

where beauty doesn‚Äôt vanish,

where joy doesn‚Äôt flee,

where the weight of this world,

finally lifts.

Perhaps, my soul belongs up there with the stars,

Free, limitless, and wild.`

        { title: "ü™ê",
            content: `I am not a maybe.

I am the certainty, the inevitable, the unwritten fate.

Not a love that fades, not a presence that wilts.

I am etched into time, carved into prophecy, woven into the stars.


I have walked through fire and did not burn

For I am the fire itself.

The flame upon the altar, the spark that calls lightning home.

Untamed. Unyielding.

I do not fall. I ascend.

A celestial storm, bending but never breaking.


I do not chase. I pull.

Like the tide obeys the moon, like time bends to the written.

Like the underworld that does not watch, it calls your name.


I do not love gently.

I am not soft. I am not safe.

I don‚Äôt just touch, I imprint.

I do not pass through, I possess.

Like a phantom in your bloodstream, a fate-bound marked in your soul.

Like an oath sworn in fire and blood, unbreakable, unforgotten.


I am not the beauty you see.

I am the beauty you feel,

A presence in the bones, a whisper in the veins.

I am divine and dreaded, mythic and omen.

A name that lingers, a force that does not fade.

A soul that is immortal.

I am magic.

Untouchable, yet inescapable.


I am gravity, the force all universes surrender to.

You will turn away,

You will look back,

Again.

And again.

And again‚Ä¶

Because I am a legend carved into celestial stones.`

        { title: "üå¨ C.03.",
            content: `Sometimes, in my weakest moments, when the world feels too heavy, she appears, shaped by my longing heart.

Her presence is like a soft, calming breeze that brushes away the weight of my despair.

She reaches for me gently, her hands as warm and tender as ever, as if she‚Äôs holding that fragile piece of my soul, and with a gaze that I adore, she looks deep into my eyes. In that moment, I can feel my soul calming, my inner wars ending, my anxiety fading into comfort.

With a voice so soft, it almost seems like a whisper of a memory, she says, ‚ÄúHold on, baby, a little longer. I know you can do this, and I know you will.‚Äù

She leans in, forehead almost touching mine, ‚ÄúYou know I‚Äôm with you, even when I‚Äôm not here. We‚Äôll always be with each other.‚Äù

I feel the warmth of her touch, the softness of her thumb as she wipes a tear from my cheek. And then, with a soft smile she whispers, ‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù

But just before I can say it back, she begins to fade.

I am left alone, surrounded by my tears, my delusions, and the bittersweet remnants of a love that exists only in my mind.`

        { title: "0", content: `
In your eyes, the eyes that ignite my soul

I see sorrow, deep, unspoken and nearly hidden.

In your silence, my heart feels the weight of your sadness,

In your tears, I see your exhaustion,

A longing for peace that feels just out of reach.

And in them, I see my own helplessness,

A pain that mirrors yours, yet cannot ease it.


Yet my mind clings to the hope of solace in one of the words you say.


Perhaps your words soothe me so,

That when you leave,

When I can no longer see or hear you,

My soul might finally find rest.

Perhaps my heart will stop shattering with every thought of you.

Maybe then, I‚Äôll believe you‚Äôre safe,

And I can free you from the prison of my mind.


"I‚Äôm sorry", you said,

And in your voice, I heard sincerity.

But what you didn‚Äôt know, my love,

Is that I forgave you long ago.


I forgave you every time,

For my love for you carries forgiveness like a shadow.

No matter what happened,

No matter the storms we faced,

I always found my way back to forgiving you,

loving you,

As deeply and purely as the first time.

I thought it was dumb, but after all it was pure love.


So let go, my dearest,

Let the guilt fall away

Release the weight of self-blame you carry.

You are worthy of the peace you will find

Worthy of love and happiness untainted by regret.


"I love you," you said,

And for a fleeting moment, it rekindled the ashes of my broken heart.

But then came words that tore it apart.


Oh, my dearest, my sweetest love, my chosen soulmate,

You will weather every storm.

You are the first prayer on my lips each morning,

And among the countless I offer, one will surely be answered.


God must know by now how stubborn I am,

How rebellious,

And how relentless my devotion is in praying for you.

The angels are jealous of you, my love

The way I utter your name to God repeatedly,

The way I persist each day, asking for nothing but your happiness and safety.


Demons and wandering spirits must envy you as well I believe,

For you are the center of my every plea.

My beloved, you are cradled in God‚Äôs safeguard and protection for sure,

Sheltered by the love I send with every breath and prayer.

Crowded by the pieces of each other's souls we exchanged long ago.


Though distance and everything else separate us,

I am with you always in spirit, in prayer, in quiet devotion.


You will rise again, like always

Stronger than ever,

Carry on, hold on

And you will bloom into the beauty I‚Äôve always believed you to be.

And,

You know,

I love you in every version.

            { title: "L", content: "If opportunities were sold, I would have bought them all and spent them on our love, even if it cost me my soul. But she doesn‚Äôt want to‚Äîshe no longer feels anything for me.

I, the resilient one who was never shaken by anything, was defeated by her words: "I don‚Äôt love you anymore," "You‚Äôve become just another ordinary person to me."

Between believing those words and swallowing the bitterness of her lack of feelings toward me, I die and come back to life thousands of times each day, for months now. Truly, not metaphorically. After her words, something inside me died. Darkness managed to occupy my chest entirely, and since that day, I‚Äôve been struggling, day after day, to keep some semblance of life within me.

I carry a heart overflowing with pure love for someone who has completely discarded my love, with a soul burning with longing for eyes that no longer wish to see me, for a body that no longer desires my embrace, for a soul that no longer feels at home with mine, for someone who no longer cares about me at all.

Yes, I made mistakes‚Äîwe both did. We both exhausted each other to the brink of death. But months later, questions still gnaw at my mind:

How could a love like ours die? How could it not endure? How could it vanish, dissipate into nothing? I thought such a thing was impossible! How can a lover forget? How can a loyal heart not forgive? How can someone so deeply in love remain distant for so long?

I believed that true lovers always find their way back to one another, no matter the obstacles. And I know, with absolute certainty, that what we had was more real than anything else in this world.

Or was it fate? The same fate that led our small, innocent hands to create all this pain and destruction‚Äîjust to separate us?

A reader of my words might think I‚Äôm foolish, pitiful, overly romantic, or exaggerating my admiration for her‚Äîor that all of this is nothing but a shot of madness. But I tried to do what she did, hoping I might survive, hoping I could stop loving her, that she would become ordinary, that I‚Äôd no longer care about her.

I summoned every painful word she said, every harm that transpired between us, every moment I cried and suffered, every night I spent weeping, every night I convinced myself that our separation was for the best, that I wasn‚Äôt meant for her.

I remembered every ache that gripped my chest, every anxiety attack, every shock, every bit of coldness, neglect, and indifference, all the repeated mistakes. I remembered the fiery jealousy that consumed me, and I blamed myself over and over‚Äînot just for my mistakes but even for my exhaustion and brokenness, for my inability to keep going, for my repeated fleeing, for how she pushed me, until I cried so much that my tears dried up.

I wiped them away, embraced myself, and showed mercy to my soul. I swore to myself that I wouldn‚Äôt love her anymore. I swore I wouldn‚Äôt love someone who didn‚Äôt see my love, who didn‚Äôt love me back. I promised I wouldn‚Äôt grieve the loss of someone who accepted my departure, who found peace in it, who saw a path in life without me.

But moments later, I found myself falling for her again like a fool. I melted into her love. I forgave all her wrongs, accepted everything about her, and overlooked every misstep.

If she asked for my eyes, I would have given them to her without hesitation, without expecting anything in return‚Äîjust to see her eyes happy.

And so, I began praying for myself, praying to my Lord to take my soul before this ended love destroys it" },
